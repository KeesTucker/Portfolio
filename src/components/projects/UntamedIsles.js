                                <p>Working on a big MMO startup was a wild experience.</p>
                                <p>I went from a University student to acting as a lead for small teams within a year.</p>
                                <p>I learnt an incredible amount during this time. Phat Loot gave me a huge appreciation for people and culture, two things I will be looking for in future jobs.</p>
                                <p>My technical skills were put to the test and with the help of my coworkers my programming skills flourished.</p>
                                <p>I gained a new appreciation for architecture, readibility, expandibility, modularity and many other programming concepts.</p>

                                <h2>Responsibilities</h2>
                                <p>Onboarding: I helped onboard some of the new hires, this was a highlight for me and I took a lot of pride in making sure they had a good introduction to the company.</p>
                                <p>Delegation: I took many of the bugs found by QA and delegated these out to the developers closest to these features.</p>
                                <p>Tooling: I created and documented many tools for the designers, level designers and other programmers.</p>
                                <p>Code Quality: I handled many merge requests and passed on my knowledge wherever possible.</p>

                                <h2>Learnings</h2>
                                <p>Untamed taught me "just because something works doesn't mean it is ready for production", working on an MMO of this scale I quickly learnt the importance of good architecture and planning.</p>
                                <p>Working between departments is extremely important and communication should always be flowing.</p>
                                <p>Communication is key to success, we suffered a lot of failures due to lack of communication. Half of my job as a programmer was communicating with the rest of the team.</p>
                                <p>Peer programming is one of my favourite ways to develop and is very valuable.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Networked real time turn based combat system. This was a really tough challenge as it wasnâ€™t instanced, the battles were in the game world and had to be networked to all the other players in vis range</li>
                                    <li>Tame/Monster Procedural Generation using Unity Jobs (Multithreading)</li>
                                    <li>Live balancing system so the team could update game-play variables and balance combat on the fly</li>
                                    <li>Region and Biome detection/tooling. Used by level designers to set the difficulty of areas. Biome data is fed into the Tame Generation and influences the procedural generation algorithm</li>
                                    <li>Leveling, exp, stat point systems</li>
                                    <li>Weather system</li>
                                    <li>Professions system</li>
                                    <li>And many more</li>
